  	"text": "Unless the male partner ejaculates some amount of semen, there is no possible chance for pregnancy to occur. These are the reasons why pregnancy is not possible unless ejaculation occurs:</p><ul><li>Semen contains sperm, the male reproductive cell and component of ejaculate that fertilizes the ovum (the female reproductive cell). Therefore, intimate acts, such as kissing, dry sex, fondling, and oral or manual stimulation, that do not result in ejaculation in or near the vagina typically warrant no risk of pregnancy.</li><li>There would be a risk if one of these acts ended with ejaculation into the vagina or onto the vulva, or if there was an ejaculation elsewhere on the body or surrounding environment but semen was somehow transferred into the vagina (e.g.- if a male ejaculated into his hands and then manually stimulated his female partner without washing off the ejaculate).</li></ul><p>If you still suspect you or your partner could be pregnant, we recommend you take a home pregnancy test or visit your doctor. It is common for stress to delay menstrual periods, so waiting to take a pregnancy test may cause additional unnecessary anxiety and the absence of a female’s next anticipated period.</p>"

  	"title" : "Medium Risk of Pregnancy",
  	"text": "Based on your response choices, we can presume there is a medium probability of pregnancy in this scenario. Here are the reasons you may have received this response:</p><ul><li>Sperm (the male reproductive cells) are mobile and fairly resilient. They can make their way into the vagina if the male ejaculates on or around the vaginal opening or if the male ejaculates onto thin or porous clothing on or around the vaginal opening.</li><li>Imperfect use of contraceptives (or use of the “withdrawal” method alone) does not sufficiently protect a female from pregnancy, especially if she is within her window of ovulation.</li><li>Unprotected sex during the first few days of the menstrual period can be riskier than it might be at other times because the decomposing uterine lining may still contain an ovum (the female reproductive cell).</li><li>The last days of the menstrual period may pose slightly less risk because it is more likely that the ovum has been shed. However, we would like to remind you that pregnancy can occur at any time during a female’s menstrual cycle for various other reasons.</li></ul><p>If you suspect that you or your partner could be pregnant, we always <i><b>recommend</b></i> you take a home pregnancy test as soon as possible. Knowing whether or not you are pregnant will allow you to evaluate all of the options available to you, especially if the results are not favorable to you and/or your partner. Time is of the essence if you wish to have the most options available. If you have taken a home pregnancy test and are still concerned or confused by the results, we recommend getting them confirmed by a doctor.</p>"

  	"title" : "High Risk of Pregnancy",
  	"text": "Based on your response choices, we would consider your probability of pregnancy in this scenario to be fairly high. The reasons you may have gotten this response are as follows:</p><ul><li>The window of ovulation typically occurs 6-15 days after the start of the menstrual cycle, and if a female’s period is irregular (or she is unsure of when it last occurred), it is difficult to asses when her fertile window might have been. During the window of ovulation you must take extra precautions in order to effectively avoid pregnancy.</li><li>If you and your partner only used the withdrawal method, and the male partner did not urinate after his previous ejaculation, there is a possibility that pre-ejaculate containing semen entered the vagina.</li><li>If there was a problem with your contraceptive method for any reason (e.g., missed birth control pills, the condom broke or slipped off, etc.), there is an exponential increase in the likelihood of pregnancy, especially if the female partner was within her window of ovulation. We would like to stress that pregnancy is most likely to occur during the fertile window, but it can happen anytime for various reasons.</li></ul><p><b>We recommend you take a home pregnancy test as soon as possible.</b> Knowing whether or not you are pregnant early on will allow you to evaluate all of your available options, especially if the results are not favorable to you and/or your partner.

    "title": "Not Enough Information",
    "text": "Unfortunately, based upon your answer selections, we do not have enough information to give you an accurate response regarding your risk of pregnancy. In order to determine whether or not a female is pregnant, there are several important factors to consider. These include the ejaculation of semen and where it occurred, contraception use (by either partner), and which stage of the menstrual cycle the female partner was in at the time of the sexual encounter. Pregnancy is most likely to occur if semen enters the vagina when a female is within or near her window of ovulation. Pregnancy is least likely to occur if there is no ejaculation, the female is not within or near her window of ovulation, or if semen does not successfully enter the vagina. Errors in contraceptive use can increase the risk of pregnancy, but the amount of increase depends on the type of contraception used, the nature of the error, and when the error occurred. <p>At this time, you may want to retake the questionnaire and revise your response choices in order to review the different outcomes that are relevant to your scenario.
