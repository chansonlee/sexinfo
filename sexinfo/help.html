		<p>The SexInfo development team has been hard at work on the latest version of the site.  We've rolled out the first bit of features, and more will be coming over the next few weeks.  Until then, you'll probably find a few bugs.  If you'd like to report them, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:sexwebmaster@gmail.com">sexwebmaster@gmail.com</a>.</p>
		<p>Please note that the development team <i>cannot</i> answer your sex-related questions.  We can answer questions about the website, though.  And because we'll be rather busy keeping tabs on all of the new changes, we may not be able to get back to you right away, but we'll try!</p>
