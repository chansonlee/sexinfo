<b><u>Perineum</u></b>- The perineum is the smooth area of skin between the <a href="http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/popups/anatomy/introitus.html">introitus</a> and the <a href="http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/popups/anatomy/anus.html">anus</a>.  There are many nerves in the perineum and it is sensitive to touch. During childbirth, an incision, called an episiotomy, is sometimes made in the perineum to prevent tearing of the tissues as the baby’s head passes through the birth canal.
