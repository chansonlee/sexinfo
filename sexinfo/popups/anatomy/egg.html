Otherwise known as the "ovum", the egg is released by the ovaries and travels into the fallopian tubes
after ovulation. If it is to be fertilized by sperm, the fertilization usually must occur in the outer one third
of these tubes. If fertilized, the egg moves next to the uterus and implants into the endometrium, where
it will develop during the ensuing pregnancy.
