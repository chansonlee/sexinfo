<h1>Definition of Premature Ejaculation</h1>

<p>A common definition of premature ejaculation is the inability
to delay ejaculation until it is mutually desirable by both partners.  This is very subjective, and can vary from
5-10 minutes to hours depending on whom you ask.  How long a man is able to delay orgasm is not really the issue
when defining and diagnosing premature ejaculation.  The real question is whether both partners are satisfied by the
sexual encounter.</p>
