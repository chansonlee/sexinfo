<h1>Start-Stop Technique</h1>
<p>The Start-Stop technique is a series of exercises practiced
over many weeks or months that can lead to greater orgasmic control.&nbsp;
Generally, the technique is focused on masturbation, but can be practiced
by couples as well.&nbsp; The basic
technique is stimulation of the penis however is most comfortable until just
before the point of orgasm, and then stopping stimulation until arousal is
lower.&nbsp; Stimulation is then started
again and the process is repeated until desired length of time until orgasm is
reached.&nbsp; By concentrating on how you feel leading up to orgasm, you
can get greater control over your own orgasmic process.&nbsp; After you are satisfied with your control at this point, add
lubrication and repeat the process.&nbsp; When
this step is mastered, instead of ‘starting’ and ‘stopping,’ use subtle
adjustments to pressure and speed to control orgasm.&nbsp;
Next, try adding mental fantasy while practicing the stimulation, first
with the ‘start-stop’ technique, and then with the ‘subtle adjustments.’&nbsp;
After you are satisfied with your orgasmic control at this point, have a
‘quickie’ to contrast the difference between the two processes.</p>
