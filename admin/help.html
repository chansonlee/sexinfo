<h2>Editors</h2>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of each of the pages you'll see as an editor:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="index.php">Home</a> - Author dashboard shows you a list of all of your content</li>
	<li><a href="admin-question.php">Incoming Q&amp;A</a> - Lists the questions that have been sent in from readers</li>
	<li><a href="admin-content.php">Content Editor</a> - Go here to post your content.</li>
	<li><a href="admin-image.php">Image Uploader</a> - Go here to upload images (you need to do this before you can put them in an article).</li>
	<li><a href="admin-search.php">Search</a> - Search through content that is already on the site.</li>
	<li><a href="admin-old.php">Old Pages</a> - Lists pages older than 2.5 years</li>
	<li><a href="admin-bugs.php">Issue Tracker</a> - If something on the site is broken, use this page to report it.</li>
	<li><a href="admin-templates.php">Templates</a> - A list of Word templates you can use to send canned responses or start your articles</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to change your password, you can do so by clicking the Settings tab.</p>

<p>Also, <b>when you are logged into the admin panel</b> new buttons will appear on the public-facing part of the website. An edit button will appear at the top of each article that you can click on to immediately edit the page you're looking at.  This is useful for fixing mistakes or editing old articles you find on the website.</p>

<h2>Webmasters</h2>
<p>For webmasters, the Home tab is replaced by the webmaster dashboard. It displays a list of content awaiting review (validation of syntax, formatting, etc.).</p>
<p>Some of the pages described above have been moved under the <a href="admin-tools.php">Tools</a> tab. There are two unique admin tools under the Tools tab: the Config Editor which controls the Q&amp;A form, and the Impersonate tool for debugging.</p>
<p>Webmasters also have access to two other tabs:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="admin-category.php">Categories</a> - Add or edit the site's categories</li>
	<li><a href="admin-user.php">User Management</a> - Add new user accounts for the admin panel, and also disable old accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of this writing, the category editor is not fully functional so you may need to dig into the database to change some things.  Make a database backup before you mess with the database!</p>

<h2>Developers</h2>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion">Subversion</a> repository with source code is maintained by Chris Bednarski, who worked on SexInfo between 2008 and 2009 (and continues to provide some support).  If you need an svn account or have questions about the code, <a href="mailto:banzaimonkey@gmail.com">send Chris an e-mail</a>.</p>
<p>phpMyAdmin is installed at <code><a href="http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/admin-sql/">/sexinfo/admin-sql/</a></code>; you can find the login information in the configuration file: <code>/core/sex-config.php</code>.  It's a good idea to make regular database backups, and to make a backup before changing code or editing the database by hand.  Backups are stored in the Google Group (below).</p>
<p>You will need an <a href="http://lsit.ucsb.edu/">LSIT account</a> to access the site via FTP to make updates to the code.  Contact John to find out how to get an LSIT account.  LSIT also manages the server, and if you encounter a problem related to server configuration that you can't resolve you should contact them.</p>
<p>There are various services attached to the <code>sexwebmaster@gmail.com</code> account, including <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Google Webmaster Tools</a>.  Be sure to monitor these to keep on top of site performance problems and technical issues.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ucsbsexinfo-dev">Google Group for development</a> that contains information on setting up your development environment and suggestions for smooth workflow.  You can manage the group (i.e. invite yourself) using the <code>sexwebmaster@gmail.com</code> account.  Database backups are also kept here.</p>
