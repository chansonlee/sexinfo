<b><u>Vagina-</u></b>
A tube that extends from the vaginal opening into the female body towards the
uterus.&nbsp; The vaginal opening lies
inside the labia minora. The vagina is about 3 to 5 inches long in an unaroused
female.&nbsp; During sexual arousal, the
vagina elongates and expands.&nbsp; It
can accommodate any size penis during penile/vaginal sexual intercourse.<o:p>
