<font size="4">A loose, pendulous portion of skin that contains
both the testes and hangs below the abdomen underneath the penis. The distance
that the scrotal sac hangs below the body is dependent on temperature: in cold
temperatures it moves closer to the body, and in hot temperatures it moves
further away from the body. This movement helps keep the testes a few degrees
cooler than normal body temperature,a condition needed for most effective sperm
production.</font>
