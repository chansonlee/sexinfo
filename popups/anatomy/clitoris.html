<b><u>Clitoris</u></b>- TThe clitoris is made up of the external shaft and glans and the internal crura. The crura is the root of the clitoris from which the shaft extends. The glans is the tip of the external clitoris.. Sometimes covered by the <a href="http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/popups/anatomy/clitoralhood.html">clitoral hood</a>, the clitoris becomes erect during stimulation and sexual arousal. There are many nerve endings in the clitoris, making it very sensitive. In fact, there are about the same number of nerve endings in the external parts of the clitoris as there are in the head of the male penis. The glans is particularly sensitive to stimulation. Direct stimulation may be too intense, and even painful. Gentle, indirect stimulation, however, may be very pleasurable and may result in orgasm.
