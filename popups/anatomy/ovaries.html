<b><u>Ovaries</u></b>- There are two ovaries located at the end of each
fallopian tube.&nbsp; The ovaries can be
¾ to 1 ½ inches long oval structures.&nbsp; They
produce both eggs and female hormones.&nbsp; Each
month, one of the two ovaries releases a mature egg during a process called <i>ovulation</i>.&nbsp;
Both ovaries produce two types of hormones: estrogen and progesterone.
Both are necessary for female sexual maturation and reproductive processes.&nbsp;
