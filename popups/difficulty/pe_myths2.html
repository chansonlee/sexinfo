<p><font size="2">5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have a first orgasm prematurely, then wait for a second to be longer.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">WRONG!&nbsp; This is just sidestepping the problem and doesn’t help
anything.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By distracting yourself (thinking of baseball, for example) you can
reduce arousal.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">WRONG!&nbsp; While this does reduce arousal, this takes most of the fun
out of sex!</font></p>
<p><font size="2">7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Just wear multiple condoms.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">WRONG!&nbsp; This will reduce sensation, but it doesn’t fix the problem
and the sensation is a big part of sex.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Always empty your bladder before sex.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">WRONG!&nbsp; I have never seen anything that has supported this with any
good evidence.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One word: Alcohol.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">WRONG!&nbsp; Alcohol reduces your chances of even getting an erection in
the first place, and leads to the majority of cases of domestic abuse.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">10)&nbsp;
Just wait for old age…</font></p>
<font size="2">WRONG!&nbsp; Come
on, who wants to wait half their life to have good sex when they can just follow
a simple strategy like those listed above and have good sex now?</font>
