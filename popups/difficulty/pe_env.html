<h1>Environmental and Biological Causes of Premature Ejaculation</h1>
<u>Masturbation</u> is
a taboo subject in western society.&nbsp; While
many people and groups are showing more acceptance, masturbation is still a very
touchy subject for many people.&nbsp; Because <u>boys are much more likely to masturbate at an
early age</u>, an age when they are likely to be living with other people
(parents, siblings, etc) and not have much privacy, hurried masturbation, being
punished for masturbation, and anxiety about masturbation are likely to occur.&nbsp;
After learning a sexual response in the situation where ‘faster is
better’ is it any wonder why premature ejaculation is so common?
