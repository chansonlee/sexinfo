<h1><font size="4">Sexual Myths (That Aren’t True!) Regarding Premature Ejaculation</font></h1>
<p><font size="2">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Penile-Vaginal Intercourse is the only kind of gratifying sex.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">WRONG!&nbsp; Touching, cuddling, oral sex, etc are all gratifying sexual
practices that take the focus off the need to prolong ejaculation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Masturbation leads to premature ejaculation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">WRONG!&nbsp; While repeated rushed masturbation can contribute to
premature ejaculation, masturbation like that described in the Start-Stop
Technique actually teaches better orgasmic control.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Products like ‘stay hard’ creams/sprays can cure premature
ejaculation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">WRONG!&nbsp; While they may lead to prolonged erection, they by no means
fix the problem in the long run, and they act by removing sensation, and can be
transferred to your partner.&nbsp; The
result is basically two pair of sleeping sex organs having sex, and not having
much fun.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reducing foreplay for the man will reduce his arousal so he won’t
ejaculate prematurely.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">WRONG!&nbsp; While this does reduce arousal, this takes most of the fun
out of sex!</font></p>
