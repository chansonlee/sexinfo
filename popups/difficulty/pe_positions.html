<h1>Positions that Help with Premature Ejaculation</h1>
<p>Because muscle tension in the legs and pelvic region leads
to greater chances of orgasm, any position that required less muscle tone would
help with premature ejaculation.&nbsp; The
<u>woman-on-top</u> (or other-partner-on-top) position is very useful for many
reasons besides allowing the man to relax and focus on the feelings he has
learned to identify as his sexual response.&nbsp;
The <u>side-by-side</u> position is also useful.</p>
